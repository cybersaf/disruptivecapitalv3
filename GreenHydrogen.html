            <h2>Pillars of Green Hydrogen: A Transformative Energy Solution</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Renewable Energy Integration</h3>
                    <p>Green hydrogen production relies on electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydro. This process converts surplus renewable electricity into storable hydrogen fuel, ensuring that renewable energy can be utilized even during periods of low demand.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Case Study</h4>
                    <p><strong>Germany’s REFHYNE project</strong>, the largest electrolyzer in Europe, produces <span>1,300 tons</span> of green hydrogen annually. This hydrogen is used in industrial and transportation applications, showcasing the role of green hydrogen as a bridge between renewable energy and practical use cases.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Strategic Opportunity:</strong> Nations with abundant renewable energy resources, such as Australia, Morocco, and Chile, are positioning themselves as global green hydrogen production hubs.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
       
        </section>
        
        <section class="fade-in">
            <h2>2. Decarbonizing Heavy Industries</h2>
            <p>Industries like steel, cement, and chemicals are some of the largest carbon emitters, and direct electrification in these sectors is often infeasible. Green hydrogen offers a viable alternative by replacing fossil fuels in these energy-intensive processes.</p>
            
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p><strong>Sweden’s HYBRIT project</strong> has pioneered the use of green hydrogen in steel production, achieving a <span>90%</span> reduction in carbon emissions compared to traditional methods. This breakthrough is a blueprint for global industrial decarbonization.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Heavy industries account for nearly <span>25%</span> of global emissions. Green hydrogen’s ability to decarbonize these sectors represents a trillion-dollar opportunity.</p>
       
        </section>

        <section class="fade-in">
            <h2>3. Transforming Transportation</h2>
            <p>While battery-electric vehicles dominate passenger transport, green hydrogen is uniquely suited for heavy-duty and long-distance applications, such as trucking, shipping, and aviation. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells provide the energy density and refueling speed necessary for these sectors.</p>
            
            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p><strong>Toyota and Kenworth</strong> are piloting hydrogen fuel cell trucks at the Port of Los Angeles, significantly reducing emissions in one of the nation’s busiest freight corridors.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Hydrogen fuel cells are the future of heavy transportation, complementing the shift toward battery-electric solutions in consumer vehicles.</p>
